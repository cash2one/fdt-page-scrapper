<h3>Loss Payment (also called Indemnification)</h3>

I forgot the rules about conduct in here and now someone is threatening to sue you. What now?

You need to pay us for any lack of ours that you due to your negligence, intentional misconduct, or violation of these terms. But you need not pay out us for a loss caused by our gross negligence or intentional misconduct. 

<h3>Definitions </h3>

Loss means an amount that we are accountable for or pay in any form legally. Amounts include, for instance, a judgment, funds, an excellent, damages, injunctive relief, personnel compensation, a reduction in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for lawyer, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss could be intangible or tangible; can arise from bodily damage, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other recovery or theory; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages. 

A loss is caused by an event if the loss would not have occurred without the event, even if the function isn't a proximate reason behind the loss. 


Our Duty to Notify. We should notify you before the 30th business day directly after we understand or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be obligated to pay out. Our failure to give you timely notice will not terminate your obligation, except to the degree that the failure prejudices your capability to defend the claim or mitigate losses.

Legal Protection of a Claim

Our Control. We've control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it), unless:

You elect to regulate the defense as described below, or

We immediate you to control the defense.

Your Election to regulate. On receiving a notice of a claim for a loss, you may take control of the protection by notifying us. If you take control, each one of the following applies: 

You might choose and retain legal counsel.

We may retain our very own legal counsel at our expense.

You might not settle any litigation without our written consent if the settlement imposes a penalty or limitation on us, admits our fault, or will not fully release us from liability.
Good Faith. You and we should cooperate with one another in good faith on a state. 

No Exclusivity. Our rights under this section do not affect other rights we may have. 

<h3>Limited Period to Bring Claims</h3>

How long do you and I must bring claims against one another?

A celebration to these terms must bring any claim that party may have against the various other party that arises out of the terms or the web site within 1 year after the claim arises. If a party fails to bring any declare that party may have against the additional party within this 1-year period, the claim is barred.


<h3>Compliance with Laws</h3>
Okay, I understand the terms. Is definitely there anything I have to comply with?

You assume all knowledge of applicable law and are accountable for compliance with these statutory laws. You won't access the Website if prohibited in your jurisdiction or use the Website in any way that violates relevant governing laws, rules, or other authorities requirements. You won't transmit any content that encourages conduct that could constitute a offense, give rise to civil liability, or violates any applicable governing regulation or regulation otherwise.

Governing Law
Does the law of the territory I live in govern these terms?

No. Republic of Cyprus laws governs these terms without regard for any choice-of-law rules that might direct the use of the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction. The predominant pur-pose of these terms is providing services and licensing usage of intellectual property rather than a “sale of products.” 

<h3>Place for Resolving Disputes</h3>
If a dispute is had by me with you or you have a dispute with me personally, might it be resolved in the territory where I live?
Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising under these conditions or re-garding the web site will be subject to the special jurisdiction and venue of the courts in the Republic of Cyprus. The celebrations will submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in the Republic of Cyprus to solve all disputes. The celebrations concur that the exclusive location and forum to resolve all disputes will maintain the courts in the Republic of Cyprus, and waive any right to seek another venue because of improper or incon-venient forum.

Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising under these conditions or re-garding the Website will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and location of the courts in the Republic of Cyprus. The parties will send to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in the Republic of Cyprus to resolve all disputes. The celebrations agree that the exclusive venue and forum to resolve all disputes will maintain the courts in the Republic of Cyprus, and waive any to seek another venue due to improper or incon-venient discussion board.


Arbitration of Disputes; Exception for Little Claims

The celebrations will submit all disputes arising out of the terms-including any dispute about the existence, validity, or termination of these terms-to binding arbitration un-der the relevant arbitration laws of the Republic of Cyprus. The celebrations expressly waive their right to a trial in a courtroom of law before a judge or a jury and forfeit any to appeal the decision of the arbitrator for any reason. The celebrations will refer all disputes to the Cyprus Eurosia Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Middle (“CEDRAC”) or, if CEDRAC is certainly unavailable, to the Cyprus Arbitration and Mediation Centre (“CAMC”). Unless the celebrations agree in different ways in a writing signed by both par-ties, the arbitration will need place exclusively in Nicosia, Cyprus before an individual arbi-trator nominated by CEDRAC, or CAMC if CEDRAC is definitely unavailable. The celebrations and the arbitrator will carry out the arbitration and any related proceedings in English. The arbitrator will have authority to consider any statutory or other claims open to a consumer under applicable governing laws and regulations that are within the scope of the submis-sion to arbitration and to award all damages or additional remedies under applicable con-sumer law. The ultimate arbitral award will bind the ongoing parties. Any court having competent jurisdiction may enter judgment about the award rendered by the arbitrator. This provi-sion does not prohibit a party from bringing proceedings against the additional party before Cyprus courts or any various other court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration or to make a claim for interim or injunctive comfort. 

Instead of arbitration, you might pursue your claim in a little claims court in your jurisdiction of residence, if the state meets all the requirements for the small claims court. If you elect to file a little claims action, the issues raised in the tiny claims action will never be subject to arbitration.

Class Action Waiver
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in virtually any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party works or proposes to act in a representative ca-pacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the advanced writ-ten consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

<h3>Rights to Injunctive Comfort </h3>

Both parties acknowledge that remedies at laws may be inadequate to provide an aggrieved party with full compensation if the additional party violates these conditions, and an aggrieved party might seek injunctive comfort if a violation occurs, in addition to seeking all the remedies available at law or in equity.
