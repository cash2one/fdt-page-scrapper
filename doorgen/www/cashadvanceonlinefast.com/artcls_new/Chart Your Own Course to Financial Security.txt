It's {definitely not|not at all} easy staying {on track|on the right track} {with your personal|with your own personal} {finances|funds|budget|money}. The {mindset|way of thinking|attitude|mentality|state of mind|frame of mind} of {millions of|an incredible number of} American consumers {seems to be|appears to be}:
{Relentlessly pursue upward mobility.|Pursue upward mobility relentlessly.}
Constantly attain more "things".
Use credit {to extend|to increase} your {actual|real|genuine} income.

Haven't you {ever|ever before} wondered how {your friends|friends and family} (or {neighbors|neighbours|friends and neighbors|neighborhood friends} or co-workers) {afford|manage|find the money for} those {two week|bi weekly} vacations to {Europe|European countries}? The new {automobiles|cars} every {few years|couple of years}? The bigger {houses|homes|residences|properties}? The expensive, luxury {watches|pieces}? The private {schools|colleges|universities|institutions|academic institutions|classes} {for their|for his or her|because of their} children? {How do|Just how do} they {manage to|have the ability to} {have no|haven't any} financial {worries|concerns|problems} and a {seemingly|apparently|relatively} endless budget?

Well, {appearances|looks|performances} can be deceiving. {According|Relating|Regarding|Matching|Corresponding} to recent studies, seven out of ten American {families|family members|households|people|young families|individuals} live from {paycheck|salary} to {paycheck|salary}. So {while it|although it} may seem {that people|that individuals|that folks} are doing great and haven't {got|received|acquired} any money {worries|concerns|problems} to {speak of|talk about}, {the reality is|the truth is} {that each and every|that every} one {of these|of the} individuals {is only|is merely} one {unexpected|unpredicted|unforeseen|sudden|surprising} financial need {away from|from} {disaster|catastrophe|devastation}. Something {as simple|as easy} as an unplanned car repair or {broken|damaged|busted|cracked|shattered|destroyed} water heater {can quickly|can easily} {bring down|lower} the financial house of {cards|credit cards} {in which|where} so many {Americans|People in america|Us citizens|People in the usa} are living.

Yes, {{vacations|holidays|getaways|vacation trips|trips} are nice and everyone deserves {some time|a while|time} away,|{vacations|holidays|getaways|vacation trips|trips} are nice and everyone deserves some right time away,} right? But how much fun {is it|could it be} to {still be|be} {paying off|paying down|settling} a trip {one or two|a couple of} years {down the road|later on}? If you're {worried about|concerned about} {losing|dropping|shedding|burning off|getting rid of|sacrificing} your home to foreclosure or {your job|your task} security is {a bit|a little|a lttle bit|somewhat} shaky, how much {are you going to|will you} enjoy {driving|traveling|generating} around in a {fancy|elegant|extravagant|expensive|nice|pretty} car which costs you &#36;450 {a month|per month}?

{It's Time to|It is time to} {Get Real|COME ON} about Your Finances

Trying {to keep up|to maintain} with {your friends|friends and family} or neighbors {is an|can be an} exhausting and pointless {endeavor|undertaking}. {There {will always be|will be} {a bigger|a larger|a greater} house,|{There will be|You will see} {a bigger|a larger|a greater} house always,} a better {neighborhood|community|area}, a fancier {TV|Television|Tv set|Television set}… the list never ends! {If you're|If you are} {ready to|prepared to} {get off|log off} the financial merry-go-round of living from {paycheck|salary} to {paycheck|salary}, constantly worrying {about how|about how exactly|about how precisely} {you're going to|you are going to} pay all the {bills|expenses|charges}, {being totally unprepared for even {the smallest|the tiniest} financial {emergency|crisis|disaster}- congratulations!|being unprepared for even {the smallest|the tiniest} financial emergency- congratulations totally!} You've just {taken|used|considered} the first (and sometimes hardest) step.

{Here are some|Below are a few} simple things {you need to do|you must do} {to get a|to obtain a} fresh {start with|focus on} {your finances|finances}:

Take {an honest|a genuine} look at {your situation|your position}. {It's impossible to|You can't really} {move forward|progress} without knowing {the facts|the reality}. It doesn't {have to be|need to be} complicated. Simply make a {list of|set of} your {assets|property|resources|possessions|investments|belongings} (what {you actually|you truly} "own") {and your|as well as your} liabilities ({what you owe|your balance}).
{Create a|Produce a|Develop a|Make a|Build a|Generate a} budget. If {the word|the term} "budget" terrifies you, then call it a spending plan. It's {nearly|almost|practically} impossible {to control|to regulate} your finances {without a|with out a} budget. Again, keep it simple. {Write down|Jot down} all {sources of|resources of} {monthly|regular monthly|regular|every month} income. {Then {calculate|determine|estimate|compute|analyze|assess} your {monthly bills|regular debts}.|{Calculate|Determine|Estimate|Compute|Analyze|Assess} your {monthly bills|regular debts} then.} Hopefully {your income|your earnings} exceeds your {expenditures|expenses}, but {that's not|that isn't} always {the case|the situation|the truth}. Don't panic.
Know where every cent {goes|will go|moves|should go|runs}. For {the next|another} month, keep every receipt! {At the end|By the end} of the {four weeks|a month}, {go over|review} each receipt and total them. {{This is usually|Normally, this is} an eye-opening experience {for most people|for many people}.|{This is|That is} an eye-opening experience {for most people|for many people} usually.} {{But it|Nonetheless it} drives home {the fact|the actual fact} that cappuccinos,|{But it|Nonetheless it} drives home the known {fact that|proven fact that|undeniable fact that|idea that|simple fact that|reality} cappuccinos,} sandwiches, drinks, {magazines|publications|mags|journals|periodicals|newspapers}, and {every other|almost every other} "small" purchase you make really {add up|accumulate}. {You may {think that|feel that} because what you buy is relatively inexpensive,|You may {think that|feel that} because what you buy is inexpensive relatively,} {it's also|it is also} inconsequential. {{But when|However when} {you actually|you truly} total them {together|collectively|jointly|along|mutually|alongside one another},|{But when|However when} {you actually|you truly} {together|collectively|jointly|along|mutually|alongside one another} total them,} {it's easy to|you can} {see how|observe how} they {can really|really can} wreck a budget.
Commit to {taking on|dealing with} {no more|forget about} new {debt|personal debt|debts|credit debt|arrears}. The old adage "{when you're|if you are} in a {hole|opening|gap}, stop digging" certainly applies here. {{You will never|You won't ever} {get out of|escape} {debt|personal debt|debts|credit debt|arrears} if {you continue|you keep up} to borrow.|You shall never {get out of|escape} {debt|personal debt|debts|credit debt|arrears} if {you continue|you keep up} to borrow.} Stop bleeding money. {Put away|Set aside} your {credit cards|bank cards}.
Get current on your bills. {Late|Past due|Later|Later part of the} fees, overdraft charges, {penalty|charges} fees- why give {your creditors|creditors} even {more money|additional money} than you already owe? Make it {a priority|important} to pay your {bills|expenses|charges} {on time|promptly} and stay current. {Sign up for|Join} BillPay through your {bank|lender|standard bank|loan company|loan provider} or pay your {bills|expenses|charges} online. {{There is no|There is absolutely no} reason you should {ever|ever before} {forget|neglect|ignore} a {bill|expenses|costs|invoice|monthly bill|charge} or make a {late|past due|overdue|later} {payment|repayment}.|{There is no|There is absolutely no} {good reason|justification} you should {ever|ever before} forget a bill or make a {late|past due|later|later part of the} payment.}
{{Talk|Chat|Converse|Discussion|Have a discussion|Conversation} with {your spouse|your partner} or {partner|spouse} about money and financial goals.|{Talk|Chat|Converse|Discussion|Have a discussion|Conversation} with {your partner|your lover} or spouse about money and financial goals.} {To ensure success|To have success}, everyone {needs to|must} be working {towards the|towards|for the|on the|to the|into the} same goals. If {one person|one individual} adheres to the budget and {the other person|your partner} {is still|continues to be} spending {freely|openly|widely|readily|easily}, something's {going|heading} to implode. {{And it will|And it'll} probably be {your finances|finances}.|{And it will|And it'll} be {your finances|finances} probably.}

{Remember|Keep in mind|Bear in mind} What's Important

{It's very|It is rather} easy to get {caught up|swept up} in the financial rat-race of constantly trying {to keep up|to maintain} with {everyone else|everybody else}. {Now is|Now could be} a perfect {time to|time for you to|time and energy to|the perfect time to|a chance to|period to} take the pressure off yourself and re-focus {your energy|your time|your power} on what {is really|is actually|is absolutely|is very} important. Making smart financial decisions that {will provide|provides} {you and your family|your household} with real security is {one of the best|among the best|one of the better|among the finest} things you will {ever|ever before} do. {{Determine what|Know what} really {matters|issues|concerns|things} {to you|for you} and {what makes|why is} you truly happy.|{Determine what|Know what} really {matters|issues|concerns|things} {to you|for you} and {what makes|why is} you happy truly.}

{A few|Several} words of financial wisdom:
Money doesn't buy contentment. Think {back|back again|again} on when you've been the most happy. It probably {doesn't have|does not have} anything {to do with|regarding} {the amount of money|the money} you had. {If you find|If you discover} you've {given up|abandoned} {a lot of the|most of the} things that {brought|helped bring} you {joy|pleasure|happiness|delight|enjoyment}, consider changing things up to regain those important {feelings|emotions|thoughts} once again.
Enough is never enough. {Unfortunately|Regrettably|Sadly|However|Alas}, {there's always|almost always there is} more. Instead, {why not|you will want to} think about simplifying {your life|your daily life}. {Do you really|You don't} need {an enormous|a massive} house {and all|and everything} the trappings {that come with|that include} it? {If you're|If you are} working {a hundred|100} hours {a week|weekly} {just to|merely to} cover the {mortgage payments|mortgage repayments}, what's {the point|the idea}? You're never there {anyway|anyhow|in any case|anyways}. {Look for|Search for} ways to make real positive changes {in all aspects|in all respects} {of your life|you will ever have}.
Stuff doesn't {make you|cause you to} happy. Sure, that {big screen|silver screen} {television|tv|tv set} make {bring on|bring about} some {initial|preliminary|first|primary|original} euphoria, but {paying for|spending money on} it over {the next|another} {three or four|3 or 4} years certainly won't. {The bottom line is|The end result is} {if you can't|if you cannot} afford {to pay for|to cover} something with cash, you can't {afford|manage|find the money for} it period. Life isn't some game where whoever {has the|gets the} most {stuff|products} wins. {{Imagine|Think about|Picture|Envision|Visualize|Consider} the {peace|serenity|peacefulness|tranquility|calmness} and contentment {of having|of experiencing} no {debt|personal debt|debts|credit debt|arrears} and being {financially|economically|fiscally} secure.|{Imagine|Think about|Picture|Envision|Visualize|Consider} the contentment and {peace|serenity|peacefulness|tranquility|calmness} {of having|of experiencing} no {debt|personal debt|debts|credit debt|arrears} and being financially secure.} There's {the real|the true} win!
