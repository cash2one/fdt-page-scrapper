Since your income is your credit there is no credit check which makes our unsecured installment loans sought out online by those with bad credit.

Unsecured Installment Loan
Everyone benefits from a larger loan and more time to repay with an unsecured installment loan. You can typically get a larger loan amount when you have more time to repay a loan. When an installment loan is unsecured then you also benefit by not having to provide any collateral for the loan. Your income and your good name is all you'll need with our featured direct installment lenders.

Bad Credit Installment Loans Online
Even with bad credit you can easily get an installment loan online from our direct installment lenders. When you apply for bad credit installment loans online, all you'll need is a job and a bank account.

Short Term and Long Term Installment Loans
We provide access to short term installment loans and long term installment loans. A short term installment loan is usually for a smaller amount and takes less than 90 day to repay. Conversely, a long term installment loan is usually for a larger amount and takes more than 90 days to repay.
UsaInstallmentLoans.org's Direct Lenders aren't typical lending institutions. Most of our Direct Lenders are private investors. An investor is someone who commits capital (money) in order to gain a financial return. UsaInstallmentLoans.org has a large network of Direct Lenders and each one wants your business. Our Direct Lenders "fight" over our customers. To be competitive, they offer low interest rates or other benefits. Each customer's Direct Lender is different: Some lenders are small banks, some lenders are small companies, some lenders are made up of groups of investors, some lenders are single-person entrepreneurs. A customer is matched with a specific lender based on certain information they provide, like how much money they need, how much money they make, and if they have applied for a short-term loan before. UsaInstallmentLoans.org's system benefits both the lender and the customer: the lender offers low rates for the customer, and the customer is matched with the lender best-able to meet their needs. It's a win-win for everyone.
