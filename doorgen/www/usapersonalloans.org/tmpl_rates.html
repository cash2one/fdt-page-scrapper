<h2>[SITE_NAME] Rates and Fees</h2>
<br><br>
<p>[SITE_NAME] is not a 
lender and never makes credit decisions. For this reason, the service cannot 
provide the users of the website with any information regarding the rates and 
fees associated with particular short-term loan products and the offers, 
provided by the lenders matched with the users of the website. However, [SITE_NAME] 
is striving hard to ensure that the lenders in our network strictly adhere to 
all applicable international, federal, state and local regulations and laws and 
able to provide fair credit practices within the industry.</p>
<p>
Short-term loans 
should be used as a temporary financial instrument and can become very expensive 
in case this financial product is used for additional terms. Usually, this 
credit is associated with relatively high financial charges, rates and fees. For 
this reason, the industry is heavily regulated on federal, state and local 
levels. Moreover, the number or organizations, either governmental or 
non-governmental, which provide control over the agents in this industry and 
establish the best practices and regulative procedures, steadily grow and 
develop.</p>
<p>
We provide the 
users of the website with multiple resources and educational material, which can 
help study the industry and understand their options better to get positive 
credit experience. Thus, we recommend using the websites of [Federal Trade 
Commission] (link 
<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">https://www.ftc.gov/</a>) 
and the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] (link 
<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">http://www.consumerfinance.gov/</a>), 
two government agencies responsible for creating and enforcing the laws and acts 
that govern short-term lending and protect consumers from the cases of unfair 
lending practices and discrimination. </p>
<p>
In order to protect 
consumers from unfair lending practices, many states have implemented their own 
regulations in addition to federal laws. Individual states may govern the terms 
including but not limited to the maximum allowable loan amount, the charges that 
lenders are able to apply to loans, the number of rollovers (renewals) and term 
specifications that are available, the late fees that may be applied and the 
number of outstanding loans that consumer can have at a time. Follow the link to

The states in which 
short-term cash loans are prohibited include but not limit to Arkansas, New 
York, Vermont and West Virginia. This list is not exhaustive and subject to
