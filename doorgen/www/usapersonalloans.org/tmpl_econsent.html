<h3>The Scopes of Consent</h3>
All communications, including but not 
limited to online interactions via mobile phone, smart phone, tablets are 
considered electronic interaction. E-consent is applied when e-communication, 
including by the means stated above, takes place between you and a third party 
lender. The admission of e-consent implies that your information may be 
collected and processed electronically, transactions may be performed 
electronically, and documents may be signed and stored electronically. 
Additionally, your lender may send you electronic notifications, such as 
reports, disclosures, links to the other third party websites, links to the 
other lender’s websites and online services. </p>
Giving you e-consent you confirm that 
the e-communication mentioned above is considered of the same legal value as the 
communication by means of hard copy documentation. </p>
<b>NB:</b> 
Conducting business electronically implies that the parties involved are capable 
of going through processing with sufficient hardware and software facilities. 
Before deciding to give your e-consent you should check if your facilities fit 
the requirements for the transactions and operations you will need to perform 
electronically. These are the basic software and hardware requirements:</p>
<b>Software and hardware:</b> 
A PC or MAC compatible computer or other device capable of accessing the 
Internet, e-mail account, Internet Browser software program that supports at 
least 128 bit encryption, such as Microsoft® Internet Explorer, Netscape® or 
Mozilla Firefox®, PDF file reader like Adobe® Acrobat Reader X ® or Foxit® etc. 
Take into consideration that different transactions may require additional 
facilities. You may need to contact you lender to get specifications on the 
facilities you may need. </p>
<h3>Withdrawing Consent</h3>
Since your e-consent from our matching 
service and the processing of your information by our lenders is a one-time 
transaction, you cannot withdraw it. From the moment you are already matched 
with a third-party lender you can withdraw your consent from this lender at any 
time at no charge by sending the respective request. You should keep in mind 
that withdrawing your e-consent you can prevent the lender from providing you 
with a loan offer or credit product. You should also keep in mind that the legal 
effectiveness, validity, and enforceability of prior electronic disclosures will 
not be affected in case you request to withdraw your e-consent. You can contact 
your lender directly to find out more about the details of these procedures. 
It’s encouraged that if you change your information (electronic address, mailing 
address) you should notify your lender as soon as possible to have your 
information updated. </p>
