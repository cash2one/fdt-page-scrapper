<h2>[SITE_NAME] Disclaimer</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Short-term loans are emergency credit 
products of relatively small amounts designed for short-term financial issues 
only and can become an expensive product if used for long-term purposes. 
</p>
<p>The owner and operator of [SITE_NAME] is 
not a lender and is not involved into making credit decisions associated with 
lending or making loan offers. Instead, the website is designed only for a 
matching service, which enables the users contact with the lenders and third 
parties. The website does not charge any fees for its service, nor does it 
oblige any user to initiate contact with any of the lenders or third parties or 
accept any loan product or service offered by the lenders. All the data 
concerning short-term loan products and the industry is presented on the website 
for information purposes only. [SITE_NAME] does not endorse any particular 
lender, nor does it represent or is responsible for the actions or inactions of 
the lenders. [SITE_NAME] does not collect, store or has access to the information 
regarding the fees and charges associated with the contacting lenders and/or any 
loan products. Short-term loans are not available in all the states. Not all the 
lenders in the network can provide the loans up to &#36;1,000. [SITE_NAME] cannot 
guarantee that the user of the website will be approved by any lender or for any 
loan product, will be matched with a lender, or if matched, will receive a 
short-term loan offer on the terms requested in the online form. The lenders may 
need to perform credit check via one or more credit bureaus, including but not 
limited to major credit bureaus in order to determine credit reliability and the 
scopes of credit products to offer. The lenders in the network may need to 
perform additional verifications, including but not limited to social security 
number, driver license number, national ID or other identification documents. 
The terms and scopes of loan products vary from lender to lender and can depend 
on numerous factors, including but not limited to the state of residence and 
credit standing of the applicant, as well as the terms determined by each lender 
individually. </p>
<h3>APR Representative</h3>
<p>APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the loan 
rate calculated for the annual term. Since [SITE_NAME] is not a lender and has no 
information regarding the terms and other details of short-term loan products 
offered by lenders individually, [SITE_NAME] cannot provide the exact APR charged 
for any loan product offered by the lenders. The APRs greatly vary from lender 
to lender, state to state and depend on numerous factors, including but not 
limited to the credit standing of an applicant. Additional charges associated 
with the loan offer, including but not limited to origination fees, late 
payment, non-payment charges and penalties, as well as non-financial actions, 
such as late payment reporting and debt collection actions, may be applied by 
the lenders. These financial and non-financial actions have nothing to do with [SITE_NAME], 
and [SITE_NAME] has no information regaining whatsoever actions may be taken by 
the lenders. All the financial and non-financial charges and actions are to be 
disclosed in any particular loan agreement in a clear and transparent manner. 
The APR is calculated as the annual charge and is not a financial charge for a 
short-term product. </p>
<h3>Late Payment Implications</h3>
<p>It is highly recommended to contact the 
lender if late payment is expected or considered possible. In this case, late 
payment fees and charges may be implied. Federal and state regulations are 
determined for the cases of late payment and may vary from case to case. All the 
details concerning the procedures and costs associated with late payment are 
disclosed in loan agreement and should be reviewed prior to signing any related 
document. </p>
<h3>Non-payment Implications</h3>
<p>Financial and non-financial penalties 
may be implied in cases of non-payment or missed payment. Fees and other 
financial charges for late payment are to be disclosed in loan agreement. 
Additional actions related to non-payment, such as renewals, may be implied upon 
given consent. The terms of renewal are to be disclosed in each loan agreement 
individually. Additional charges and fees associated with renewal may be 
applied. </p>
<p>Debt collection practices and other 
related procedures may be performed. All the actions related to these practices 
are adjusted to Fair Debt Collection Practices Act regulations and other 
applicable federal and state laws in order to protect consumers from unfair 
lending and negative borrowing experience. The majority of lenders do not refer 
to outside collection agencies and attempt to collect the debt via in-house 
means. </p>
<p>Non-payment and late payment may have 
negative impact on the borrowersâ€™ credit standing and downgrade their credit 
scores, as the lenders may report delinquency to credit bureaus, including but 
not limited to Equifax, Transunion, and Experian. In this case the results of 
non-payment and late payment may be recorded and remain in credit reports for 
the determined amount of time. </p>
