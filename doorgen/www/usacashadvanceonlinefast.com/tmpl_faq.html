credit option and use it safely. </p>
<h2>What is a short-term loan? </h3>This is a relatively small personal 
credit (up to &#36;1,000) for 1-4 weeks (the terms vary depending on the regulations 
in different states). This credit option is associated with high acceptance 
rate, because the lenders secure it with borrower’s income. For this reason, 
many applicants may be approved despite their imperfect credit reputation and 
get access to this option in a relatively short time. </p>
<h2>What does one need to be approved?</h3>Qualification for short-term loans is 
simple. Lenders need only basic information about applicants to decide if it is 
secure to provide credit or not.</p>
<p>
1.
one needs to be a legal USA resident of 18 years old or more;</p>
<p>
2.
one needs to provide valid contact details;</p>
<p>
3.
one needs to be legally employed and have steady income;</p>
<p>
4.
one needs to have an active bank account for direct deposit. </p>
It is possible that lenders will enquire 
more information about applicants (for example, to send pay stubs to prove 
income) individually. In this case, the procedures can take more time and 
involve additional procedures and paperwork (faxing or scanning).</p>
<h2>Are the procedures safe? </h3>When you make your request on [SITE_NAME], 
we collect your information to process it and find the right loan provider for 
you. We encrypt your data and use industry-leading technologies to make all the 
procedures secure and protect your privacy at high level. Please, find out more 
about the way we use your information on the <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> page.</p>
<h2>How much time does it take?</h3>This financial product is considered 
relatively fast, because most processing can be performed completely online, and 
this online search and match service works 24/7. It takes just minutes to fill 
out the form and request a loan, less than an hour to process request and 
connect a customer with a lender. As soon as the lender is able to make final 
decision to approve the borrower’s application, the lender provides loan 
agreement. All one needs to do is to familiarize with the offer and make credit 
decision. If one opts for rejecting the loan offer, one can simply ignore 
further procedures and repeat loan request if necessary. If accepted, the loan 
agreement should be e-signed. Usually, it takes just one business day to have 
money sent to the borrower’s account (in case direct deposit option is 
available). In most cases, borrowers can get their money in as soon as one 
business day. </p>
<h2>Can a bad credit applicant be approved? </h3>Some lenders in our network need to 
perform credit verifications with traditional credit bureaus, the others may 
just check if an applicant is not a bankrupt or has no outstanding debts with 
other lenders. In many cases bad credit or lack of credit will not impede 
applicants from being approved, because short-term loans are secured by the 
borrower’s income. Nevertheless, low credit score and insufficient credit 
information may influence the amount and terms of loan offers, provided by 
lenders. </p>
<h2>Why does one need to contact lender directly?</h3>[SITE_NAME] works as a matching service, 
which enables users to access reputable lenders and get better loan options. We 
don’t have information regarding particular loan products or their terms. Nor do 
we make any credit decision. If the borrowers who used our service have issues 
regarding their loan contracts, they should contact their lenders directly.
</p>
<h2>Why does one need to renew a loan? </h3>Sometimes borrowers find it hard to 
repay their loans on time due to unforeseeable circumstances. In these cases, 
most lenders allow borrowers to renew their loans for additional interest added 
to the total. This option can be expensive, so we recommend contacting lenders 
before these circumstances take place to avoid additional payments and 
penalties. In addition, not all the states allow renewals. One should first 
check the status of short-term loans and applicable laws, which regulate 
short-term lending in one’s state. Use the information on <a href="/rates/">Rates and Fees</a> page 
to find out more. </p>
<h2>What happens when one can’t pay off on time or at all?</h3>The cases of defaulted payment terms are 
explained in every loan agreement together with applicable penalties, additional 
fees, collection practices and other actions associated with delinquency. One 
should check these terms before signing agreement in the first place. All the 
lenders in our network adhere to the best practices in the industry, follow 
federal and state laws and promote responsible lending practices. All the 
lenders in our network operate within the stated limits. We encourage borrowers 
who anticipate delinquency or default payments contact corresponding lender as 
soon as possible.</p>
<h2>How many loans can one take at a time? </h3>The number of credit products taken 
simultaneously as well as the “cooling time” terms are determined by the laws of 
each state (if applicable). Additionally, every lender reserves the right to 
determine the maximum of simultaneous and/or consequent credit agreements within 
the limits of applicable laws. It’s recommended to inform a lender about current 
credit standing and the facts of defaulted loans before any agreement is signed.</p>
