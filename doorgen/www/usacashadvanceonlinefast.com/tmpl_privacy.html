<p>The information shared with our third 
party lenders can be used to verify Your identity (via SS number and/or driving

Additionally, the lenders we contract with may need to perform credit 
verification and use Your PII to request a credit report from one or more credit 
organizations, including but not limited to the major credit bureaus, to 
determine Your credibility and assess the risks associated with providing credit 
products to You. Credit report request may lower Your credit score. If You 
continue using the Website and submit Your information via the online form on

indirect communication, including but not limited to telemarketing calls,

You have provided in the online form. Either we or third party lenders and 
marketers can use this number even though it is listed in any corporate, state, 
or federal Do-Not-Contact registry, suppression lists or the like. Since Your

make a purchase or receive a service, the processing and application of Your 
request is performed according to the provisions of Amended Telemarketing Sales 
Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the &quot;ATSR&quot;). According to ATSR, even if Your 
telephone number is listed in FTC Do-Not-Call List, we are authorized to contact 
You upon Your given consent using telemarketing. Since Your inquiry to third

as a an attempt to make a purchase, according to ATSR these third party 
marketers are also authorized to contact You using telemarketing. </p><p>By giving Your consent to use the 
Website and provide Your information to use our services, You confirm that You 
are at least 18 years old and legally authorized to own and use a mobile device.
