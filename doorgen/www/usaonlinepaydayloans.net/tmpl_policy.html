<h2>[SITE_NAME] Policy on Responsible Lending</h2>
<br><br>
<p>We are not a loan providing service, nor 
do we represent or endorse any lender. But we are working hard to provide you 
with access to reliable lenders and match you with the lenders who can offer you 
loan products according to the information you submit in our online form. 
</p>
<p>We put maximum efforts to ensure that 
all the lenders in our network are legitimate loan providers adhering to 
federal, state and local laws, fair and responsible lending practices and the 
best practices in the industry. </p>
<p>We understand that short-term loan 
industry can be puzzling, as it is regulated in many states heavily and 
differently. For this reason, we provide you with the necessary information and 
educational material on the industry to answer your questions regarding 
short-term loans in the USA. In this section we’ll provide the basic information 
regarding the major laws and acts that secure and protect consumers from unfair 
practices. We encourage you go through this information and read the basics on 
[How It Works], <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> and <a href="/rates/">Rates and Fees</a> pages to understand your credit 
options better and make only smart and reasonable credit decisions. </p>
<h3>Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</h3>
<p>We strictly insist that our lenders 
follow the guidelines put in place by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. We 
are not a lender, so we will never make any attempt to collect a debt from you. 
However, our lenders have the right to use all lawful means available to them to 
collect your debt if your loan is unpaid. They must follow the guidelines of the 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act when doing so. These are some of major 
actions deemed as violations:</p>
<p>•Using any harmful, oppressive, foul or 
harassing language or tactics in order to collect debt;</p>
<p>•Attempting to contact debtors before 9 
a.m. or after 8 p.m. in their local time zones;</p>
<p>•Using deception, falsifying information 
or misrepresenting a company in order to collect a debt;</p>
<p>•Threaten criminal charges or any legal 
action when such legal action is not warranted.</p>
<p>Any lender within our network found to 
be in violation of these guidelines will be immediately removed from our network 
and reported to law enforcement.</p>
<h3>Fair Lending Act</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Fair Lending Act is 
to ensure that all consumers have equal access to credit despite their age, 
race, creed, gender, religion or other non-financial factor. The Act ensures 
that consumers are not discriminated against and that they have access to the 
loan and other forms of consumer credit as long as these consumers can meet the 
legal and financial guidelines associated with obtaining such credit. If you 
feel that you are a victim of discrimination, please contact the Equal 
Opportunity and Fair Lending Office of your local Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau.</p>
<h3>Truth in Lending Act</h3>
<p>The Truth in Lending Act was established 
to ensure that consumers have all of the information about an offer of credit 
available to them in writing before they take any responsibility and e-sign any 
contract or decide to extend any credit. Lenders are required to disclose 
information about the rates, fees, interest and terms associated with loans 
before they provide any credit to any consumer. Each state has its individual 
regulations regarding short term lending, and lenders are required to ensure 
that all offers are in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<h3>State Regulations</h3>
<p>Many states have implemented their own 
regulations for the short term lending industry in an effort to protect 
consumers. Some of the things individual states regulate include the maximum 
loan amounts, fees and interest, the number of rollovers that are available and 
more. The general information about the regulations in specific states can be 
found in our <a href="/rates/">Rates and Fees</a> section of this website. You can find the links to 
the governmental websites with detailed explanation on short term loan 
regulations and up-to-date rate limits in different states.</p>
