<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
</p><p><b>"America's favorite writer" (<i>The New Yorker</i>) begins an all-new trilogy-inspired by the inn she owns and the town she loves. </b></p><p>The historic hotel in BoonsBoro, Maryland, has endured war and peace, changing hands, even rumored hauntings. Now it's getting a major facelift from the Montgomery brothers and their eccentric mother. As the architect of the family, Beckett's social life consists mostly of talking shop over pizza and beer. But there's another project he's got his eye on: the girl he's been waiting to kiss since he was fifteen...</p><p></p>

<h2>Editorial Reviews</h2>
<article>
<div><b>Publishers Weekly</b></div>
Perennial bestseller Roberts draws extensively on her experiences of renovating and operating Inn BoonsBoro for this trilogy launch not so much set in as advertising the bed-and-breakfast and its adorable neighboring town. Architect Beckett Montgomery has had a crush on Clare Brewster since high school, and sparks finally fly between them when Clare gets involved in the work of restoring the historic Maryland hotel. The widowed Clare has a bookstore to run and three small boys to take care of, but Beckett reminds her how to lean on others for help and fall in love again. Roberts paints a charming picture of smalltown life with likable characters, but supernatural thriller elements feel out of place in the bucolic contemporary setting, and too much detail about the nuts and bolts of the innâ€™s restoration slows down the story. (Nov.)
